# Spam Email Detection
This project is a comprehensive machine learning solution for classifying emails as spam or not spam. Using a Random Forest Classifier, it identifies spam emails based on their content and various features extracted from the dataset. This project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing, all of which are documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Introduction
With the growing volume of spam emails, effective filtering systems are essential. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble method known for its accuracy and resistance to overfitting.

The notebook demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and testing, providing a clear and reproducible workflow for spam email detection.

## Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for building the model.
Jupyter Notebook: For developing and documenting the code.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, etc.).
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis tools.

## Usage
Data Preprocessing: The email text data undergoes cleaning (removal of stop words, tokenization, etc.) and vectorization using TF-IDF to prepare it for model training.
Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Test the model with new emails and see if it correctly classifies them as spam or ham.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of thousands of labeled emails. It includes the following labels:

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

Spam: Emails that are unwanted or suspicious.
Ham: Legitimate emails that are not classified as spam.
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle and includes a mix of spam and non-spam emails to train the model effectively.

## Model Description
Random Forest Classifier: This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to improve the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting. The classifier is trained using preprocessed email text, which is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
Evaluation
The model has been evaluated using the following metrics:

## Accuracy: The overall percentage of correct classifications.
Precision: The proportion of correctly classified spam emails out of all emails classified as spam.
Recall: The proportion of actual spam emails correctly identified by the model.
F1-Score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced measure of the model's performance.

Here are the results of the model:

Accuracy: ~98%
Precision: ~97%
Recall: ~96%
F1-Score: ~96.5%
These metrics indicate that the model is highly effective at detecting spam emails with minimal false positives and negatives.

## Future Improvements
Deployment: The next step could involve deploying the model via a web application or API, allowing users to classify emails in real time.
Testing with Other Models: Experimenting with additional models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or deep learning models to compare performance.
Feature Engineering: Exploring more advanced NLP techniques for feature extraction, such as Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings.
